# Child and Infant Mortality Analysis 

![Child Mortality Context](childmortality0.webp)
---
## Introduction
This project examines child and infant mortality data across various countries, with a focus on key factors influencing mortality rates, trends over time, and the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Through data cleaning, merging, and analysis, the project provides insights into the state of child and infant health across different countries.

## Problems Solved

1. Cleaning and preprocessing of eight separate datasets.
2. Merging datasets into a single cohesive file: `merged_cleaned_data.csv`.
3. Handling missing values to ensure data completeness.
4. Analyzing trends in child and infant mortality rates.
5. Exploring relationships between healthcare metrics and mortality rates.
6. Identifying countries with the highest and lowest mortality rates.
   
## Project Context

Child and infant mortality remain significant challenges in Africa, driven by various socio-economic, healthcare, and policy-related factors. This project aims to:
Understand the key contributors to mortality rates.
- Assess the impact of immunization and healthcare initiatives.
- Identify actionable insights for reducing mortality.
- The project involved cleaning, merging, and analyzing datasets to generate meaningful visualizations and recommendations.
- This analysis is part of a training project undertaken as a trainee at Regonet Global. The datasets were provided by my tutor, Mr. Dayo Dada, as the final project of the program.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Efficiently handled missing values and inconsistencies across multiple datasets.
- Data Integration: Merged eight datasets into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Applied statistical methods and visualizations to derive meaningful insights.
- Data Visualization: Created engaging and informative visualizations using Python libraries.
- Report Writing: Documented findings and actionable recommendations effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Analysis and Key Findings

1. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis**:
  A line plot that analyze trends in child and infant mortality rates over the years and bar plot highlighted the steady decline in under-five and 
   under-fifteen mortality rates from 2001 to 2011.
  
- **Regional Disparities**: Countries such as Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Central African Republic showed significantly higher mortality rates.
  
2. ### Correlation Insights
- Strong positive correlation between under-five and under-fifteen mortality rates.
- Negative correlation between skilled birth attendance and mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of accessible healthcare.
  
3. ### Key Visualizations
- **Heatmap**: Showcased correlations between variables, identifying significant relationships.

## Limitations
1. **Data Coverage**: The dataset only includes data from 2001 to 2011, excluding more recent trends.
2. **Data Completeness**: Missing values in some datasets may impact the accuracy of the analysis.
3. **Causation vs Correlation**: While correlations were identified, causative relationships could not be established due to the scope of the project.

## Conclusion

This project highlights critical insights into child and infant mortality in Africa, emphasizing the need for improved healthcare coverage, immunization programs, and maternal health services. Countries with high mortality rates often face socio-economic and healthcare access challenges that require targeted interventions.

### Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Immunization Programs**: Increase immunization coverage for diseases like DTP3 and Polio to reduce preventable deaths.
2. **Improve Maternal Healthcare**: Enhance access to skilled birth attendants and maternal healthcare services.
3. **Expand Healthcare Coverage**: Provide affordable health insurance, especially in low-income countries.
4. **Focus on High-Mortality Countries**: Prioritize interventions in countries like Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and the Central African Republic.
